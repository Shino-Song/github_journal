Not too much of note. Just hitting things on and off, especially when it comes to the coding thing.

My laptop took a shit with the battery, which became quite the spicy pillow, but got the process of replacing it going. Hopefully it isn't going to hit the bank too hard, as I imagine it being a touch over 3 years old, it will probably be out of warranty. We will see.

For the coding shiz, I continued a bit with the Boots.dev course, getting another 3 lessons done last night. Took me a minute to remember to put "()" at the end of a function call, but I got there after a minute ㅋㅋㅋ

As for now, I'm trying to get myself to pus a little more on actually updating this journal thing, thus this entry. I should look at making an entry for the 한국어 portion, but laziness abounds me and I just can't be arsed tonight.

Speaking of Korean, classes are going well. Well, I mean progress is being made, but I probably could be doing better if I put more effort into it than I am. No real excuses on that, I'm just letting other nonsense get the better of me most of the time as I try to keep my mindset in a positive place. Not that there is anything wrong, I just really don't want to approach general burnout and find myself giving up on things to stablize.

That will be it for today's entry.

Looking at this file, I'm noticing there is some intereting formatting going on with how things are typed. I will have to look into it more so I can utilize it for more interesting visuals and not completely up my text ㅋㅋㅋ But that is beside the point.

Today was fairly decent. Not much to write home about. Major standouts was attempting to get a battery repalcement. Apparently the Laptop manufacturer's sales portal doesn't like that I live in Korea and rejects to accept my address in any form as valid. Hopefully it is a matter resolved soon as doing a complete shutdown of my laptop when I need to move rooms is quite bothersome.

Honetly wasted today as well after work. Couldn't get anything personally productive done during work hours as I had no preps today and just back to back classes. When I got home I just crashed mentally. It happens, nothing to beat myself over, just gotta make sure to make better use of tomorrow. My main goal for this week is to get my studying in for Korean and also get the foundation of another module for my financial software developed. I might also try to make some more progress on Boot.dev, but that is a touch lower priority for this week's juggle.
