Not too much of note. Just hitting things on and off, especially when it comes to the coding thing.

My laptop took a shit with the battery, which became quite the spicy pillow, but got the process of replacing it going. Hopefully it isn't going to hit the bank too hard, as I imagine it being a touch over 3 years old, it will probably be out of warranty. We will see.

For the coding shiz, I continued a bit with the Boots.dev course, getting another 3 lessons done last night. Took me a minute to remember to put "()" at the end of a function call, but I got there after a minute ㅋㅋㅋ

As for now, I'm trying to get myself to pus a little more on actually updating this journal thing, thus this entry. I should look at making an entry for the 한국어 portion, but laziness abounds me and I just can't be arsed tonight.

Speaking of Korean, classes are going well. Well, I mean progress is being made, but I probably could be doing better if I put more effort into it than I am. No real excuses on that, I'm just letting other nonsense get the better of me most of the time as I try to keep my mindset in a positive place. Not that there is anything wrong, I just really don't want to approach general burnout and find myself giving up on things to stablize.

That will be it for today's entry.
